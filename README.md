## Description:

The project is divided into three programs and named `App`,`Sale`,`Stock` and it is written in java language and uses basic Object Oriented Programming (OOP's) concept such as Inheritance and other concepts.

1.App Class:

   The App.java program contains the main method from which the code runs.The main method has a switch case which is used for a menu driven for printing in the console. The switch case has three cases being Add Inventory,View Inventory,Billing/Invoice and finally one for exiting the program.

   The add inventory case adds inventory for objects which are inputed from the console, the method InputStock is in the Stock.java file and when the add inventory runs for the second time it stacks the data.

This was a university project which I had to submit, I thought why not submit it for cs50x too.
