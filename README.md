# CUSTOMER BILLING SYSTEM USING INHERITANCE

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Video Demo

## Description

The project is divided into three programs and named `App.java`,`Sale.java`,`Stock.java` and it is written in java language and uses basic Object Oriented Programming (OOP's) concept such as Inheritance and other concepts.

**1.App Class**:

  - The App.java program contains the main method from which the code runs.The main method has a switch case which is used for a menu driven for printing in the console. The switch case has three cases being Add Inventory,View Inventory,Billing/Invoice and finally one for exiting the program.
  - The Add inventory case adds inventory for objects which are inputed from the console, the method InputStock is in the Stock.java file and when the add inventory runs for the second time it stacks the data.
  - The View inventory shows how of the stock is left and general details of the object such as name, quantity, price, quantity original bought for and availability of the stock from the method PrintStock in `Stock.java`.
  - The Billing\Invoice prompts the user to buy the object and print the invoice from the `Sale.java`.

3.Stock.java:

## How to Run the Program
1. Compile `App.java` using `javac App.java` in console.
2. Run the `App` class to start the menu interface using `java App` in the console
3. Choose options from the menu to interact with the inventory and billing features.
